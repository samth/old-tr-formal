* Accumulators (lab9-1.scm) :

** Find the largest number in a list from left to right

** Find the smallest number in a list from left to right
 how would we change the previous function?

** How would we do it without an accumulator? (right to left)

* Quiz

* Lecture - the exactness of numbers

** Demo weird results:
Why does this happen?  What can we do?

** Representation of inexact numbers

*** First try - n digits

This only represents 10^n numbers.  
What do we do when we go over?  under?

*** Second try - exponent form

two digits for base
two digits for exponent
base called mantissa

**** define this in drscheme
define-struct
inex+
inex*

**** complications

***** missing numbers
what numbers are missing?
gaps get larger as number get larger

***** out of range
overflow
underflow

** How does it work in Scheme?

*** exact and inexact
when should we use each?

* Vectors

** What are vectors?

** Why would we want vectors?

** How do we create vectors?

** How do we access vectors?

** How do functions recurse over vectors?
