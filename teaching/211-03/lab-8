Generative Recursion:

Go over the basic concept
- Algorithms recurse in ways that don't appear in the data def
- numbers are a good example
	- gcd
- also graphs
	- course prereqs as we saw in class
- also fractals

- First problem to demonstrate
	- exponentiation
	A^B = A*A^(B-1)

- Next problem to demonstrate (work through together)
	- factorial
	n! = n*n-1!

- work out themselves
	- fibonncci
	f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

- then fractals
	- seirpinski excersize from the book
	- 27.1

- then a sierpinski square
	
- then we are done
