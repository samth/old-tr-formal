Problem:
--------
Develop the function _intercepted?_. It consumes a list of "bombs"
(represented as disks) and a target (also represented as a disk).
The function produces true if any of the "bombs" touches the "target";
if all bombs are amiss, the function produces false.

Structure and data definition:
 (define-struct disk (x y radius))
 ;; A Disk is (make-disk Number Number Number)

Two disks touch each other if the distance between their centers
(points)
 is less than the sum of the two radii.

Given domain knowledge:
-----------------------

You may use the following function.

;; distance : Posn Posn -> Number
;; measure the distance between two positions given as (x1/y1 and x2/y2)
(define (distance x1 y1 x2 y2)
  (sqrt (+ (sqr (- x1 x2)) (sqr (- y1 y2)))))

(= (distance 0 0 3 4) 5)
(= (distance 15 8 3 3) 13)

Solution:
---------
Remember to develop one task per function.

For each function, pick a design recipe: domain, structural or
generative. Follow the appropriate design recipe.

After some planning, decide whether or not you also need an accumulator.
If you do, say so and adapt your design recipe.
