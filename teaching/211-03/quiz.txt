I am requesting that you don't save this message in the CCS
file system. Apparently, the students are searching our homework
directories. One of them sent me email and the other one posted
on the newsgroup. Leave it in your mbox and do the copying
as late as possible. Thanks -- Matthias

definition generates.

Grading guidelines: Spend less than 10 seconds per
quiz:

  ** If it looks approximately right (a define-struct, a line of text
     with (make-??? ...) and String/Boolean/Number), give the students
     the benefit of the doubt (1).

  ** If it looks really wrong (not just parentheses, mixed up
     results) or if it's blank, give them a 0.

Report 0 as homework grade for the respective students. For
the others, there is nothing to report.
