;; A List of Number is either
;; - empty
;; - (cons Number List-of-Number)

;; Design a function sorted?, which determines if a list of number is in increasing order.

;; Design a function sum-of-squares, which computes the sum of the squares of all the numbers in the list

;; Design a function squares, which produces a list with all the numbers squared.  

;; Reimplement sum-of-squares using squares.
