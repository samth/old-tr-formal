abstract = {    An algorithm can be regarded as consisting of a
logic component, which specifies the knowledge to be
used in solving problems, and a control component,
which determines the problem-solving strategies by
means of which that knowledge is used. The logic
component determines the meaning of the algorithm
whereas the control component only affects its
effkiency. The effkiency of an algorithm can often be
improved by improving the control component without
changing the logic of the algorithm. We argue that
computer programs would be more often correct and
more easily improved and modified if their logic and
control aspects were identified and separated in the
program text.}

abstract = {Sentences in first-order predicate logic can be usefully interpreted as programs. In this paper the
             and fixpoint semantics of predicate logic programs are defined, and the connections with the proof
theory and  model theory of logic are investigated It is concluded that operational semantics is a part of proof
theory and  that fixpoint semantics is a special case of model-theoret:c semantics
