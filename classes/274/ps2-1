Problem Set 2

Sam Tobin-Hochstadt


Problem 1.
-------------

A) AGp <=> ~EF~p

This is true, since if p is true everywhere along all paths, there
does not exist a path where ~p is ever true.

B) EG(p | q) <=> EGp | EGq

Counterexample

. p
|
v
. q
|
v
. p
|
v
. q
|
v
. p

C) (p & AG(p => AXp)) => AGp

This is true, since if p is true now, and whenever p is true, then it
is true in all successor states, then by simple induction, p is always
true along all paths.

Problem 2
-------------

Xp = p SU TRUE

p U q = q | p SU q

Gp = p & p SU FALSE
