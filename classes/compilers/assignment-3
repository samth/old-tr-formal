For assignment 3, I worked on 

* Learning about the larceny build system, so that I could compile a CVS version.

* Actually building larceny.

* Testing the compiler on the newly-built larceny

* Learning about the Twobit optimizers.  

* Documenting the progress I made on the project wiki we created.
