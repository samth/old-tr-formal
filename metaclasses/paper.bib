                a generic and individual exists when a class is
                abstracted into an individual in order that it may have
                properties [Brachman83]. Looking back to Figure 7, we
                had a case where eagle was split into two parts so that
                it could have properties such as endangered. One of the
                problems that arose from this approach was the
                relationship between the two objects eagle and the
                eagle. The abstraction relationship was described
                merely to point out that, in a system where only
                instances can have properties, if classes were to have
                properties they would have to be repreFIGURE 9. An

                relationship to denote the fact that the two objects
                should be interpreted as different views of the same
