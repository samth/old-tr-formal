Consider a component registry CR, which consists of a set of component
directed graphs. Each component in a graph is labeled with a unique
id.  Each edge in the graph is labeled with an API name.

Installation consists of the addition of a new component graph to CR.  

Upgrade/Component consists of replacing a subset of the components
labeled with a particular id.

Upgrade/API consists of replacing a subset of the components who are
the source of an edge labeled with a particular API name.

Upgrade can potentially replace nodes below the specified one as well.
